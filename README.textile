h1. Web.Generics

h2. Motivation and Goals

Web.Generics is yet another component (or framework) to accelerate .NET application development.

The main goals for the product are:

# Try to help programmers do their jobs. It this is not possible, at least don't put barriers to their work.
# Make it work fast, get feedback from customers and then optimize what is needed.
# Domain Driven Design rocks!
# Avoid "leaky abstractions":http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html
# Simple is good.

h2. Requirements

* .NET Framework 3.5 (4.0 for the Futures Assembly)
* NHibernate 3.0 Beta 1
* Fluent NHibernate 1.1
* Microsoft Unity 2.1

h2. How to use it

# Add the components to your application
# Go to global.asax.cs and add the following:

bc.        protected void Application_Start()
        {
		ApplicationManager.Initialize(Assembly.Load("<domain model assembly>"), Assembly.Load("<infrastructure assembly>"), <fluent configuration object>, <IoC mappings object>);
		MvcApplicationManager.DefineControllerFactory();  // if using MVC, to enable dependency injection in controllers
	}

bc.        protected void Application_BeginRequest()
        {
            AspNetApplicationManager.BindSessionToCurrentContext(); // Nhibernate's session-per-request pattern
        }

bc.        protected void Application_EndRequest()
        {
            AspNetApplicationManager.BindSessionToCurrentContext(); // Nhibernate's session-per-request pattern
        }

.. and you are ready to go. See the sample application and reference for more information
