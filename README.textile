.h1 Motivation and Goals

Web.Generics is yet another component (or framework) to accelerate .NET application development.

The main goals for the product are:

1. Try to help programmers do their jobs. It this is not possible, at least don't put barriers to their work.
2. Make it work fast, get feedback from customers and then optimize what is needed.
3. Domain Driven Design rocks!
4. Avoid "leaky abstractions":http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html
5. Simple is good.

.h1 Requirements

 * .NET Framework 3.5 (4.0 for the Futures Assembly)
 * NHibernate 3.0 Beta 1
 * Fluent NHibernate 1.1
 * Microsoft Unity 2.1

.h1 How to use it

1. Add the components to your application
2. Go to global.asax.cs:

@
        protected void Application_Start()
        {
		ApplicationManager.Initialize(Assembly.Load("<domain model assembly>"), Assembly.Load("<infrastructure assembly>"), <fluent configuration object>, <IoC mappings object>);
		MvcApplicationManager.DefineControllerFactory();  // if using MVC, to enable dependency injection in controllers
	}

        protected void Application_BeginRequest()
        {
            AspNetApplicationManager.BindSessionToCurrentContext(); // Nhibernate's session-per-request pattern
        }

        protected void Application_EndRequest()
        {
            AspNetApplicationManager.BindSessionToCurrentContext(); // Nhibernate's session-per-request pattern
        }
